<h3> Google Search is a great use case for analyzing data based on search queries.</h3><br>
* In this project, I have tried to find the top 10 countries which search the word "Machine Learning".<br>
* I have also tried to plot the trend of seaches of this particular word in recent years.
* To access the data, we have to use a Python library called** _pytrends_**. To install it, run **_pip install pytrends_**.
